# Making your NextJS Blog searchable

## 1. Overview

I've recently migrated my personal website to NextJS and started adding my blog posts. After fiddling finally getting the
styles to a point where *I'm* happy with it, I thought that making my blog searchable might be a very good idea.

My reasoning behind this that the blog hosts my notes from courses I've completed and snippets I find flying around the web,
and it would be *really* useful if I could search of the snippit instead of having to remember which blog entry contains which useful snippet.
